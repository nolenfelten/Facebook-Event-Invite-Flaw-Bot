# Facebook-Event-Invite-Flaw-Bot

Facebook event's are used by ravers (<3) and promoters to bring people to the party.
There is a limit for how many invites one account can send. 

However :), if an account has there phone number verified, and you visit the event page using a spoofed Useragent on your browser to show that you are using an Android device, you can send as many invites as you would like.
But you must do it manually.

Yeah, right.

Using Python and Firefox, along with the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium">Selenium</a> module, this can actually be taken advantage of.
